#### AERONET Geo Processing Pipeline
AERONET netCDF processing pipeline for all available AERONET locations. <br>

Given a list of netCDF files, process the near grid point relative to a given AERONET location. <br>
process all locations at [list](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/aeronet_locations_v3.txt) and all netCDF files within the given filelist.txt <br>
Output to: csv/[netCDF file].csv <br>
